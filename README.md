See [subject](https://github.com/cariestevez/get_next_line/blob/main/get_next_line.en.subject.pdf)

↪︎ Function to read content from a file, stdin, or even a network connection, that reads into a variable buffer and returns line by line.
This function will be used during the rest of the cursus.

It could be considered a reinterpretation of the original C functions fgets or getline.
